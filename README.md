# ExpressionGenerator

##Synopsis
This is a short script meant to generate test-cases for expression evaluators. Simply select the complexity (roughly determines expression length) and the number of expressions you wish to generate, then click "Generate".

##How it Works
I literally don't know yet. It probably doesn't work. This is still a work in progress ;_;.
